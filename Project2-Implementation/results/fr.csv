I’m Michele Knoll, and  am running to represent Pennsylvania’s 44th House District. The 44th District is entirely within Allegheny County, and if you have flown into the Pittsburgh International Airport you’ve visited PA44. 

This district has been a long held Republican seat in the State Legislature but only by a small margin. I ran in 2018 I fell short by just a mere 1,000 votes and our current sitting State Senator and Congressman have recently flipped seats blue. We learned in 2018 that if we can flip 15 votes per precinct we can take this seat back. 

I have been an Educator for over 30 years in Pennsylvania and I’ve been determined to to live a life of service. I’ve served as a traditional classroom teacher and now am a Developmental Therapist. I’ve served as a School Board Director for our local public schools, started a Non-Profit to help deliver books to underprivileged children and I’ve raised my family here. 

I am committed to serving our community and ensuring a bright future for all. As an Early Interventionist Educator for children with delays and disabilities, I have visited families in their homes to help work one on one with a child that may be facing development milestones. During these visits over the last ten years, I’ve worked with families in the district that have experienced threats of homelessness, food insecurity and are facing educational inequities no family should have to endure. 

We need an advocate in Harrisburg that understands the life long impacts that a quality education can have on a child. Pennsylvania has the most unequally funded education in the United States. We need a Representative in Harrisburg that ensures all children in Pennsylvania receive a quality education.  I promise when I am sent to Harrisburg to serve, I will be that voice."
r/VoteDEM,j9rp16,"Hello, my name is Heidi Campbell, I am the Democratic nominee for Tennessee State Senate District 20 (TN-20 / Nashville Metropolitan Area).

I am also the former 2 term Mayor of Oak Hill, TN, during that time I returned over $2 Million to my city’s reserves by eliminating my own pay and balancing the budget.

While we are passionate about so many issues, we are running to help our environment, expand Medicaid for Tennesseans, empower black voices, legalize marijuana, and strengthen our education system.

r/VoteDEM,jerxrb,"I am Ryan Quinn and I am a Democrat running for The Iowa Legislature in House District 57.  I am a software engineer by trade but have always been passionate about politics and have volunteered on campaigns often since first going door to door with my parents canvassing in 1984.  I have been a supporter of open source software throughout my career having created the [SymphonyOS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Symphony_OS) Linux distribution in 2004.  I've worked both for local companies in web development and for global companies having first joined DigitalOcean as one of the first twenty employees and helped in it's growth to nearly 700 people when I left and now working in Developer Relations at MongoDB as a remote employee helping to build community and promote education in tech.

In 2018 I spent most weekends leading up to the election driving the Democratic candidate for this seat as she canvassed across Dubuque County.  This year I was concerned as the primary season went by without a Democratic candidate stepping up and in August I reached out to friends with the county party to learn how I could help us win back this seat.  

I was told that the party had not been able to find a candidate despite this district having more registered Democrats than Republicans and it having been a Democratic district prior to the current incumbent's two terms.  Most candidates for public office spend months making a decision and putting things in motion but I was told that the special nomination convention would be in just two days.  Having the passion and ability to seek this office and knowing the alternative would be an uncontested seat I felt compelled to step up.  I spoke with my wife and kids and before the end of the week I was the nominee for Iowa House District 57.

Since kicking off my campaign in mid August I have found a great group of volunteers, found support from my friends and co-workers and benefited from the assistance of other local Democratic legislators and the county party.  Starting from zero we now have over 200 yard signs out around the county, delivered a direct mail piece to all 3550 Democratic and No Party households voting absentee and placed door hangers at another 2000 homes.  Without direct support from the state party or large PACs we created radio and video ads in-house which are now running on five local radio stations and on YouTube and Facebook.  

While this race is an uphill battle it is winnable!  District 57 includes most of Dubuque County outside the city and consists of rural areas, small towns and suburbs.  With factories, farms and tourist attractions the district is a microcosm of Iowa.  Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by a couple hundred with a large contingent of No Party voters.  

The key issues that are important to me are:

- Fully funding our public schools and returning Iowa schools to being the best in the nation.

- Fighting for working families by supporting a fair minimum wage and making sure that agencies tasked with ensuring safe workplaces are properly funded.

- Ensuring affordable and accessible healthcare including mental health services and reversing the GOPs disastrous experiment in the privatization of our Medicaid program.

- Restoring the collective bargaining rights of our teachers and all state employees.

r/TrueCrime,j99vjq,"[Proof](https://imgur.com/UVkxHeL)

As the son of the late Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes, crime has been my life’s work. From 1989 until 1994, I worked in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office investigating and prosecuting high profile cases. In 1994, I opened a criminal defense firm and represented all sorts of criminal defendants.

In 2001, I returned to the prosecution side at the request of then Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro. There I worked on cases as diverse as the sexual abuse scandal at The New York Archdiocese to the prosecution of The Gambino crime family. In 2002, I was assigned to be the lead investigating prosecutor in the re-investigation of the disappearance Kathleen Durst (HBO documentary *The Jinx*).

For the last 10 years I have been writing and producing for television. I have written on HBO’s *Perry Mason*, *USA’s Dirty John*, *Starz’ Power Book 2: Ghost* and others.

Currently I am hosting a podcast about one of my highest profile cases People v. Jones. [Heeled: The Curious Case of Marla Trump’s Shoes](https://heeledpodcast.com/reddit) is certainly the most bizarre true crime case I have encountered. I think you’ll love it.

r/AlaskaPolitics,j2455k,"We are the Alaskans for Better Elections team, and we're excited to bring more choice, more voice, and more power to Alaskan voters with ballot measure 2! Ask us anything about the reforms that will make our elections more transparent, fair and open.

Ballot Measure 2 includes three commonsense election reforms to reduce partisanship and elect leadership committed to moving Alaska forward. It ends the secret influence of dark money, creates a single unified primary open to all voters, and empowers voters in the general election to rank candidates in order of preference. These simple, nonpartisan updates to how we choose our leaders will return the power of elections to its rightful place — with the voters.

Ask us anything. We will begin answering questions at 10:00am tomorrow.

In the Texas of today, we can expand Medicaid and protect the Affordable Care Act while also supporting our small businesses. We can equitably and fully fund our schools and teachers while also investing in a robust economy, and…we can protect our environment while remaining a global leader in energy.

Like Texas, HD 121 is changing, and I believe it’s time our leadership changes, too. I would be the first Democrat, the first Latina, and the youngest person to ever represent this district. Let’s change the face of power in Austin and start fighting for policies that will lift up every Texan."

Hello fellow privacy advocates,

we believe Freedom can only exist with privacy. Without it we are lost. That is why we quit our jobs and started [Safing](https://safing.io/) to fight mass surveillance through software. We are after true privacy, so only having the right attitude is not worth much. A chain breaks at its weakest link, quickly turning the whole company into another parasite serving surveillance capitalism.

That is why we said and say ""No"" to Venture Capital (to keep ownership and control), we release our software as FOSS (so users can validate), we have a business model (to be sustainable in the long run) and strive for hyper-transparency as a company.

**One App with Customizable Privacy Features**

We have had busy years of research and development, all leading up to one main FOSS product: [The Portmaster](https://safing.io/portmaster/), which protects your computer (Windows/Linux) by intercepting _all_ your network connections at the kernel level. Different privacy features can then be enabled or disabled as desired:

- Privacy Filter - Block Unwanted Connections. Free to use.
- DNS Resolver - Enforce DNS over TLS. Free to use.
- SPN: Multi-Hop Privacy Network. Monthly Subscription, in closed pre-alpha. ^Here's ^how ^it [^compares ^to ^Tor](https://safing.io/blog/2020/01/22/how-the-spn-compares-to-tor/) ^and [^VPNs](https://safing.io/blog/2020/01/22/how-the-spn-compares-to-vpns/)

**Ask Us Stuff You Would Not Ask Other Companies**

There's a pattern: the less open a company is, the less privacy you should expect. Just look at the tech titans. That's why we support the QtASK project ^[[1]], initiated from within this community, and rant about VC online ^[[2]]. We've decided to be counter-culture - so literally ask us anything! Be it financial, legal, conceptional, hiring, team, you name it - we will answer everything.

^(There still will be a line we won't cross, especially in regards to our private lives [we're privacy enthusiasts nevertheless], but the worst thing that can happen is that we respond with an explainer of why we won't answer)

_&gt;&gt; We are Safing, Ask Us Anything &lt;&lt;_

r/California_Politics,jb2cbo,"Hey everyone! Coming to you live from my kitchen where I’ve been working for the last seven months, **I’m CalMatters election reporter Ben Christopher**, and I’d be happy to answer any questions you have about California’s 2020 election.

If you’re unsure about how you’re going to vote (or how to vote at all), check out the [2020 California voter guide](https://calmatters.org/election-2020-guide/) that my colleagues and I made.

It covers all 12 state propositions with short, easy-to-understand descriptions, breakdowns on who is for and against each measure, and details on how much money each side is pouring into the election.

The guide includes:

* Our “[Props In 1 Minute](https://calmatters.org/politics/california-election-2020/2020/10/california-props-minute-video-playlist-2020/)” video series, where we explain each proposition in 60 seconds.
* A quiz, [Gimme Props](https://gimmeprops.calmatters.org/), that might help you decide how to vote on each ballot measure.
* Snapshots of the most competitive [legislative](https://calmatters.org/election-2020-guide/california-assembly-races/) and [congressional](https://calmatters.org/election-2020-guide/california-congressional-races/) races, as well as some analysis on [California’s role](https://calmatters.org/election-2020-guide/how-california-is-influencing-the-presidential-election/) in the presidential election.

If you have questions about campaign finance, what different election outcomes might mean for California, voting procedures or voter fraud, how I got my desk plant to look so green and vibrant — I’ll start answering them at **10 a.m. PT on Oct. 14**.

&amp;#x200B;

Our current representative has been in office for 27 years. It’s time the 42nd has a representative who is in touch with constituents and their concerns. It's time for a second New Deal and for the Democratic party to get back to its working class roots.

&amp;#x200B;

I want Medicare for all so people can move jobs without losing benefits and so America isn't dead last in health among wealthy countries. I want a Green New Deal so we can invest in the jobs of the future instead of clinging to a dirty past. I want paid sick and family leave for all so people don’t have to choose between their health and their rent. I want a universal basic income so we can abolish poverty once and for all. I want a $15 minimum wage so that people working full time can afford a dignified and independent life. I want tuition-free public colleges and trade schools so young people can pick up the skills they need for a 21st century economy.

r/politics,ikm5ja,"Want to help our democracy? Want to make a difference? Want to learn more about how elections work? Want to make a little extra money? If you answered yes to any of these questions, consider signing up to be a poll worker.

Poll workers are the temporary workers or volunteers who run your neighborhood polling place. They welcome you to the polling place, check you in, give you a ballot or direct you to a voting machine and finally give you an “I voted” sticker. Recruiting poll workers is always a challenge for election officials. Per [@eacgov](https://twitter.com/EACgov) data, in 2018 nearly 70% of reporting jurisdictions had some difficulty finding enough poll workers.

That was before COVID-19, which has dramatically impacted the willingness of traditional poll workers to serve this year. That makes sense, as the majority of poll workers are over age 60 and in higher risk categories for complications from COVID-19. The decision to serve as a poll worker during this pandemic is a personal one. No one should sign up who does not feel comfortable or confident in the decision. For those willing to serve, you are needed (including bilingual poll workers who can help with language assistance).

Election officials need people to sign up, but more than that, they need people that will show up. The most difficult situation for election officials is last minute cancellations or no shows.

r/VoteDEM,ikw46r,"I’m Emily Skopov and I’m running to represent the 28th legislative district of Pennsylvania because, like many of you, I expect more from  our government, and I know our families deserve it.  


People have  lost faith that the values on which America was founded are being upheld  by our elected leaders. Too many of the policies coming out of  Harrisburg and Washington, D.C. don’t adequately solve the problems  facing hard-working Pennsylvanians. Many feel defeated and hopeless  about a system that seems corrupt and rigged. I’ve raised my children not to wait for someone else to solve a problem but to instead step forward to be part of a solution. And with all the problems demanding  attention in our communities, I knew it was time for me to step up and  run.

I learned the value of hard work from my parents, a small  business owner and a public school teacher. I attended public school in my working class community and learned the importance of high-quality  public education to provide children with the tools and opportunities to build themselves a meaningful, rewarding and productive life. I worked at my dad’s neighborhood  drugstore and learned the critical skills of financial planning and budgeting;  valuing and investing in your employees, customers, and community;  contributing to and encouraging growth in the local economy; and how to  quickly adapt to changes in the market. My passion for, and commitment to, small businesses is rooted in their flexibility, responsibility, and  loyalty — they have to be there for their customers and accommodate  their needs through even the most difficult times.

This solid  working-class foundation allowed me to obtain degrees from Columbia  University and the University of California Los Angeles, and to have a  successful career as a screenwriter and director before moving to Marshall Township in Allegheny County with my husband and family a  decade ago. Since then, I have committed myself to my community by  volunteering in the North Allegheny Schools; starting a nonprofit that  prevents environmental waste and gets educational and art supplies into  the hands of those who need them most; being appointed to Marshall  Township’s Parks and Recreation Board; serving on the boards of the Northland Public Library Foundation, Braveheart Foundation, North  Allegheny Rowing Association, and as a founding member of our  synagogue’s social justice task force; and now, running for office to serve and advocate for this community both locally and in Harrisburg.

I am running because my  community wasn’t being heard and their values weren’t being represented  in our state government. I believe that elected officials are public  servants and that it is a privilege to be the voice of our community. The political extremism that has paralyzed our government and turned neighbors against one another must end, and I  will restore common sense in the public interest to government.

This  is my second run for this seat. In 2018, I came within 9 points of then  Speaker of the House Mike Turzai, and he opted to retire rather than to  take this campaign on a second time and risk defeat. This district is the fastest Democratic-trending state house district in Pennsylvania. We have built a campaign that is now polling ahead of our opponent, and with  hard work and abundant support, we're going to flip this seat, and with it, the Pennsylvania legislature.

r/law,jj51im,"I’m Jack Newton and my company, Clio, aggregates data we gather to create the Legal Trends Report which creates a snapshot of the state of the legal industry. (Canada exports more than just Justin Bieber and maple syrup. I promise.)

Clio is the world’s first and leading creator of cloud-based legal practice management software, with over 150,000 customers spanning 90 countries. We used anonymized and aggregated responses from 150,000 legal professionals using Clio over the last two years and survey responses from 1,000 legal professionals and 1,000 general consumers in the U.S. We aimed to measure what’s considered important in an economy facing major changes due to COVID-19.
 
Here’s a few quick takeaways:
 
This year, we found that  firms with that adoption adopted new tech quickly are projected to collect nearly $40,000 more annually per lawyer,
Our analysis showed that firms using electronic payments, client portals, and client intake and CRM solutions collected nearly $20,000 more per lawyer in 2019.
Survey data also showed that physical, in-person legal services are far from the default for law firms with 79% of law firms relying on cloud technology to store firm data, and 83% meeting with clients virtually.
The shift to virtual, cloud-based legal services may already be well underway. Seven percent of legal professionals said that they had let go of their commercial office space after the start of the pandemic, and 12% are unsure if they will keep their commercial office space in the future. 
The majority of consumers also favor a lawyer who offers technology solutions with 69% of consumers preferring to share documents electronically, 65% preferring to pay through electronic payments, and 56% preferring video conferencing over a phone call.

r/TexasPolitics,j1cndi,"Hi all - I'm doing an Ask Me Anything beginning at 10 a.m. today. 

**About the Race for Texas Railroad Commission:**

The Railroad Commission has nothing to do with railroads.  It is our powerful oil and gas regulator, overseeing all upstream production in the state, as well as some pipeline issues.  This race has been called the ""most important climate election in the Nation"" this cycle.  The Railroad Commission position is a statewide seat and it will be at the very top of your ballot, right under the federal races.

**Why am I running:**

Because I have over 35 years of experience in and around the industry as both an engineer and a lawyer and can get the Railroad Commission out of the ditch it's in.  The current commission is  destroying both our economy and our environment in the way it is handling oil and gas issues.

We need to get the Railroad Commission back on track, enforcing the laws that protect our natural resources. These laws have been on the books for over 100 years, but the current commissioners refuse to enforce them.  These laws prohibit flaring  (the intentional lighting on fire of natural gas) and venting (the intentional or unintentional release of raw natural gas to the atmosphere). In 2019, operators wasted enough natural gas to power every home in Texas if the flared gas was converted to electricity. We don't need to waste the oil and gas we spend billions trying to capture.  We can turn it to electricity right there in the Permian and fuel new industries that will help diversify the economy and provide energy stability.  

**Who is the incumbent on the ballot?**

**Trick question: there isn't one!**  Ryan Sitton lost his primary to Jim Wright, a deeply flawed candidate whose oilfield waste recycling business was ordered to cease and desist operations by the Railroad Commission and was issued 255 regulatory violations.  He was fined over $180,000 and has been sued for fraud by his business partners, with the latest lawsuit filed approximately 10 days ago.  ***If Jim Wright can't follow the Railroad Commission laws, he shouldn't be the Railroad Commissioner.***

I became the first in my family to graduate from college. While at UT Austin, I worked for Sarah Weddington, the attorney who argued and won Roe v. Wade. I am currently law partners with Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins. As a lawyer, I take on insurance companies and pharmaceutical corporations and help my fellow Texans who have been hurt. I also own a small waste disposal business. My opponent Ron Wright has a laundry list of extreme positions, including a suggestion to use public beheadings and hang bodies on fences to reduce crime. This district is one of the top targets to flip in Texas this cycle – a recent poll showed us within the margin of error – and we can win this.

I will start answering questions around 10!

r/books,igdtq3,"I am a linguistic anthropologist who has spent over thirty years traveling to a small village in Papua New Guinea documenting the death of an indigenous language called Tayap. When I first arrived in the village in 1985, Tayap was spoken by about ninety people. Today it is spoken by less than forty. My book, A Death in the Rainforest: how a language and a way of life came to an end in Papua New Guinea, is part memoir, part discussion of how a language dies and a culture atrophies, and part whodunit mystery. It describes what life is like in a rainforest – both for the people who live there, and for a visiting anthropologist – and it discusses how a group of people very far away from anything we might want to call “the West” think of white people and insist on being included in white worlds. I look forward to answering any questions you may have!

r/books,ifqs6l,"Hi! I am Barbara and I own Brant’s Books in Sarasota, Fl. Having worked for the original owner-when I was a kid- and growing up in the business, I kinda know a little about books! My store has been open over 64 years and has an inventory of over 150,000 used books, while my warehouse has an additional 100,000. (Just found that out since we’ve had extra time to count everything!!) Signed, out of print, collectible and lots of great bestsellers grace our shelves, and fill my building. Mix that in with lots of reading nooks, comfy chairs, soft music and did I mention the most amazing Bookstore dog ever??(Even if he does sleep all day!) How much closer to bliss can you find? Enjoy being surrounded by generations of words and ideas. Bookstores create community and books spread knowledge. Knowledge is power.

My customers tell me that if there is ever a Zombie Apocalypse, Murder Hornet rampage or over abundance of Karens on the street, my store is where they want to be. Being 2020, no one is surprised by anything anymore. Ask Me Anything, but my question to you is, if you were barricaded inside of my Bookstore-with craziness going on outside, what book would you grab first to read???

r/history,jjp7fe,"Hey everyone! I’m Thomas Moynihan and I’m currently working with Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute. I completed a PhD at Oriel College on the history of human extinction and am about to publish a book (“[X-Risk: How Humanity Discovered Its Own Extinction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1913029840)”) that charts how and when our species first became concerned about the fact that it might disappear forever. If that piques your curiosity, check out this expanded timeline from the book that revisits some of the most important milestones in this great, and ongoing, drama of human inquiry: https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/how-humanity-discovered-its-possible-extinction-timeline/.

 
I’m here today to answer any questions you may have about how humans came to contemplate their own extinction. Many of you will instantly be thinking ‘but haven’t humans been prophesying the end of the world since religions began?’, and you’d be right. But, as I contend in the book, the modern idea of human extinction distinguishes itself from the tradition of apocalypse as it is found across cultures and throughout history. Human extinction is a strangely new idea: one that I argue could not exist until a few centuries ago. And, what’s more, I think that our discovery of it is one of humanity’s most important accomplishments…
 

Want to know how our [ideas about aliens](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/world-end-history-cosmos-apocalypse-universe-earth-a9456011.html) have always influenced how we think about our own fate down here? Or how the surprise discovery of dolphin intelligence made us afraid of our own ingenuity and technology? Want to know about the writers who have argued that it is our duty to explode the world (and even the entire universe), or the scientists who boldly suggested that we reorganize not only the whole planet, but also the entire Solar System, so that we can escape that creeping cosmic cold?
 
I’m thrilled to be here (from 12 – 2ish EST) and looking forward to hearing your questions! AMA!

r/askscience,jiz09w,"Since March, clinical microbiology laboratories have faced shortages of testing supplies, including SARS-CoV-2 molecular test reagents. Due to the growing demand and need for COVID-19 testing, production of supplies required to test for other infectious diseases has dwindled. This has led to a ripple effect of shortages and is causing a major delay in testing for common infections, such as urinary tract infections, sexually-transmitted infections including chlamydia and gonorrhea, gastroenteritis and cystic fibrosis.

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) on approaches being taken to catalogue, track and address these supply shortages. In particular, we'll discuss a new platform developed by the Association for Supply Chain Management and the ASM to monitor real-time levels of, and demand for, COVID-19 testing supplies down to the level of individual laboratories. We'll also answer your questions about future decisions about supply chain management of laboratory reagents and testing protocols. Ask us anything!

r/Political_Revolution,jfj8gw,"My name is Beth Doglio and I’m a community organizer, climate activist, and Congressional candidate.
 
I've been [endorsed](https://www.bethdoglio.com/endorsements/) by over 150 local and national elected officials including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pramila Jayapal. I'm supported by every Tribe in the district and have also been endorsed by Washington State Labor Council, National Education Association, and the Sunrise Movement.

I made it past a 19-person Primary in Washington’s 10th Congressional District and now I'm going against a corporate Democrat in the General. I am running on a progressive platform that:

 - puts working class people first by strengthening unions
 - prioritizes bold legislative climate action in a Green New Deal
 - advocates for Medicare for All
 - puts housing at the top of our agenda

You can see a full list of my priorities here: https://www.bethdoglio.com/issues/
 
I have 30 years of experience as an organizer, including:

 - Leading the Power Past Coal campaign and stopping 7 coal export terminals
 - Passing Clean Building legislation to create thousands of jobs
 - Providing key leadership passing 100% Clean Electricity, a model for the nation
 - Passing a bill giving part time state workers (who are majority women) the right to organize
 - Strengthening prevailing wage laws and helping ensure passage of Paid Family Leave Act
 - Driving record levels of funding into the Housing Trust Fund
 
The single greatest motivator for my run for this office is that the stakes are too high – on climate, on guns, on housing, on choice, on issues affecting working families – we need progressive leadership urgently. Especially during a global pandemic. The issues at hand need someone willing to advocate for their constituents in the challenges they face now and in the vision for recovery. Not a former CEO of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce that led an attempt to buy seats on the Seattle City Council in 2019 on behalf of corporations' interests to not pay their fair share. We've seen enough of that in this pandemic where U.S. billionaires' wealth grew immensely at the expense of struggling Americans. I want to change the rhetoric that Congress can be directed by corporate dollars.

While my opponent accepts thousands from corporate PACs I have gained the support of over 15,500 individual donors with an average contribution of $57.45. This is a people-powered campaign and I wholeheartedly believe I will serve the people's interests better than my opponent. AMA!

r/BlackPeopleTwitter,jxrkr2,"I'm Matthew Finney. I'm a Data Scientist and Algorithmic Fairness researcher.
 
A growing number of experiences in human life are driven by artificially-intelligent machine predictions, impacting everything from the news that you see online to how heavily your neighborhood is policed. The underlying algorithms that drive these decisions are plagued by stealthy, but often preventable, biases. All too often, these biases reinforce existing inequities that disproportionately affect Black people and other marginalized groups.
 
Examples are easy to find. In September, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528) users found that the platform's thumbnail cropping model showed a preference for highlighting white faces over black ones. A 2018 [study](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html) of widely used facial recognition algorithms found that they disproportionately fail at recognizing darker-skinned females. Even the simple code that powers automatic soap dispensers [fails](https://www.mic.com/articles/124899/the-reason-this-racist-soap-dispenser-doesn-t-work-on-black-skin) to see black people. And despite [years](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06280-5) [of](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMms2004740) [scholarship](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2735726) highlighting racial bias in the algorithm used to prioritize patients for kidney transplants, it remains the clinical standard of care in American medicine today.
 
That's why I [research](https://twitter.com/Skillsoft/status/1309178090774462464) and [speak](https://lunchtable.com/playlist/K3Ppe0Ua-the-tyranny-of-algorithmic-bias-and-how-to-end-it/on-demand) about algorithmic bias, as well as [practical](https://mattfinney.github.io/fairness-privacy-practice/) [ways](https://www.skillsoft.com/resources/understanding-bias-in-data-pg8354a1) to mitigate it in data science.

r/legaladvice,jxbny2,"Big News. We are launching an AI and we will be hosting an AMA to explain what is going on. 

**The AI**: Locationbot will have a new friend - the Reddit Eviction help bot. 

The Eviction Help Bot uses the legal issue spotter [Spot](https://spot.suffolklitlab.org/) which was initially developed by the Suffolk Law School [Legal Innovation &amp; Technology Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/) in conjunction with Stanford Law School's [Legal Design Lab](https://law.stanford.edu/organizations/pages/legal-design-lab/). ***Spot is essentially an ""AI"" or ""learning Machine"" which was developed using questions and answers posted right here on /r/legaladvice***. The questions were then run through a [game played by law students and other legal professionals](https://learnedhands.law.stanford.edu/). In the course of this game the players taught Spot to identify legal issues when they were written in normal conversational English by regular OPs.  

The bot is deployed when Spot identifies a message or a question on /r/legaladvice to be related to housing. If the legal issue in a message is identified as a housing issue, then the bot responds by referring the user to the [legalfaq platform](https://legalfaq.org/). Legal FAQ provides users with jurisdiction specific information regarding eviction on a local, state and federal level. The platform functions as a ‘front door’, it provides users basic orientation on their rights and then hands them off to service providers who can help them.

Because Spot is a learning machine as there are more interactions with it, it will grow smarter and be better able to help people looking for legal assistance. 

**The AMA**

On Friday, November 20th at 4pm ET/1PM PT members of Stanford's Legal Design Lab,  Suffolk's Legal Innovation and Technology Lab, and yours truly will answer any questions you may have about this bot, legal AI in general, how learning machines work, and anything else that strikes your fancy.

r/askscience,k0qxtu,"In the last 10 years, the poles have been warming four times faster than the rest of the globe. This has led to permafrost thawing, which has big implications since permafrost currently covers 24% of the earth's landmass. Many of these permafrost layers contain ancient microbes that haven't seen warm air in hundreds or even thousands of years. This leads scientists to wonder what microbes will ""wake up""? And what will happen when they do?

I'm Dr. Kimberley Miner and I study how the changing climate impacts the most extreme environments in the world. My research explores the risks of climate change from more fires to hurricanes to flooding. But I also research microbes, which is an important area of climate change risk we rarely discuss. I co-authored this recent piece in Scientific American called, ""Deep Frozen Microbes are Waking Up.""

r/IAmA,jqgr6j,"The average US adult footprint is **30 tons**.  About half that is direct and half of that is indirect.

I wish to limit all of my suggestions to:

   * things that add luxury and or money to your life (no sacrifices)
   * things that a million people can do (in an apartment or with land) without being angry at bad guys

Whenever I try to share these things that make a real difference, there's always a handful of people that insist that I'm a monster because BP put the blame on the consumer.  And right now BP is laying off 10,000 people due to a drop in petroleum use.  This is what I advocate:  if we can consider ways to live a more luxuriant life with less petroleum, in time the money is taken away from petroleum.

Let's get to it ...

If you live in Montana, switching from electric heat to a rocket mass heater cuts your carbon footprint by **29 tons**.   That as much as parking 7 petroleum fueled cars.

35% of your cabon footprint is tied to your food.  You can eliminate all of that with a big enough garden.  

Switching to an electric car will cut **2 tons**.  

And the biggest of them all:  When you eat an apple put the seeds in your pocket.  Plant the seeds when you see a spot.  An apple a day could cut your carbon footprint **100 tons** per year.

r/IAmA,jpxkog,"Proof: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/jpwv9x/hi\_this\_is\_me\_im\_actually\_the\_scout\_who\_got\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/jpwv9x/hi_this_is_me_im_actually_the_scout_who_got_all/)

I started Boy Scouts at about 10 years old after crossing over from cub scouts.  Sometime in my second year, I met a scout who, like I would years later, was about to earn every single merit badge.  I was inspired by him to attempt the same thing, and after eight years of studying, hiking, biking, meeting interesting people, and doing some really tough, fun, and interesting things around the country (and parts of the world), I finally accomplished the same thing.  In total, I earned 138 of the 137 badges offered (one was discontinued and replaced along the way).  It is my proudest accomplishment so far.

And for one quick FAQ:

*What are merit badges and why is this significant?*

Merit badges are awards offered by the Boys Scouts of America for fulfilling various lists of requirements.  They are all so diverse and unique that I can't really give a ""typical"" case of one, as they range from something simple like learning about fingerprints and taking your own, to biking for long distances (hundreds of miles depending on the terrain you select), to learning complicated topics like Nuclear Science, Drafting, etc.

Of course, doing 138 of them adds a much greater level of difficulty.  You have to get a qualified and registered counselor to sign off that you satisfied the requirements, such as Astronaut Michael Finke who helped me earn Space Exploration and countless other wonderful people who I could list for quite some time.

As far as the significance, as I said it took a bit less than eight years to achieve.  In the 100+ year history of Scouting in America, fewer than 500 people have accomplished this goal.  For reference, the extremely prestigious rank of Eagle was earned by over 60,000 people in the year of 2019 *alone* (I say this not to minimize the award of Eagle Scout, but to provide a frame of reference for how rarely this is achieved).

My name is Alex and I run The Pipsqueakery. My partner, Jason (u/CrossP), might also jump in here but he has a lot of animal care to do today while I have a bunch of computer work.

The Pipsqueakery is a 501c3 rescue based in Bloomington, IN that takes in rodents and rabbits with a focus on those with special medical needs. We care for mice, hamsters, rats, squirrels (captive bred and permitted only), guinea pigs, degus, chinchillas, rabbits, gerbils, capybaras, patagonian cavies, prairie dogs, groundhogs, ducks (because why not ducks, one hedgehog and probably a few others that I'm forgetting because I'm constantly sleep deprived.

Some factoids to get you started: 

We recently took over rescues in Arkansas, New Jersey, and New Hampshire so that's been interesting. 

We're in the process of building a facility. 

We believe that animal rescue and human rights intersect such that we have to consider both in all that we do. 

I work a full time job in addition to running the rescue. Jason is a stay-at-home hamster dad. 

We spend a ton of money on vet bills, and I have to help more than one rabbit pee multiple times a day.

Hi Reddit! 

I’m India Oxenberg—advocate, author of “Still Learning” on Audible, and former member of NXIVM—and I’m here to answer your questions. I’m joined by Rachel Bernstein, a family therapist, cult specialist, educator, and host of the podcast IndoctriNation, who has been integral to my journey of recovery. Together we both appear in the four-part STARZ docu-series “[Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult](http://starz.tv/WatchSeducedRT).”

I spent seven years in NXIVM, starting at age 19. At the time I joined, I didn’t recognize that it was a cult. I was unknowingly being groomed by the group's leader, Keith Raniere (who was just sentenced to 120 years in prison last week) and his inner circle of enablers. 

Coming to terms with what happened to me—discovering what was true as opposed to what I was indoctrinated to believe—has been a long process. And it didn’t begin until Keith was arrested and I began cooperating with the FBI. My life had been hijacked and my free will systematically manipulated by the organization’s secret Master slave group, DOS. 

People often ask, “How could this have happened?” The answers aren’t simple and telling my story for the first time in the series wasn’t easy, but I’m doing it in the hopes that abusers of power like this will be stopped and held accountable—and so that this never happens to anyone else.

I’m the journalist and senior campaigns and elections editor behind [POLITICO’s Election Forecast](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/race-forecasts-and-predictions/) rating the 538 Electoral College votes to the 435 House districts and everything in between.

Here’s how things are looking this year:

* In the race for the White House, Joe Biden is the favorite as we wrap up the last week of the campaign. There’s still a plausible path for President Trump to win an Electoral College majority – but it has grown much narrower. (Here’s [my field guide from last week](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/22/biden-swing-state-polls-431287) to the recent swing state polls.)
* The race for Senate control is close to a coin flip. Democrats have built leads in states that were previously considered up for grabs and put new states firmly on the map.
* In the House, Democrats strengthened their grip as the national environment swung toward them. Our latest ratings place a majority of seats in the Democratic column, even if Republicans win all of the toss-up seats.

These ratings are the product of a rigorous process, analyzing election results, registration trends, the national political environment, public polling and private survey data. They also reflect conversations with dozens of campaign operatives, pollsters and other sources.

Michael Cannell here. My new book, A Brotherhood Betrayed, focuses on the brief moment before World War II erupted when America's attention was fixated on the streets of Brooklyn—the streets where Murder Incorporated held court. This is the story of the one man who attempted to take them down.  


I've also written books about The Mad Bomber of NYC (Incendiary), the 1961 Grand Prix Circuit (The Limit), and a biography of architect I.M. Pei. Once upon a time I was an editor at the New York Times and I've also written for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and many other publications.

r/IAmA,jk7ybb,"Last April, I posted [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fuv88f/i_am_a_japanese_dude_having_been_a_shutinaka/) without any idea of the result. It blew up. I got tons of exposure thanks to this subreddit, which gave me some media coverage, precious opportunity to participate in big gaming events, friendly connections among the game dev community...

So I want to say thank you to all of the viewers and commenters on my last AMA. I've wanted to do this for a long time!

In the last AMA, I was asked many times about my daily schedule. Fortunately, I got help from Youtube contents creator Sean. We made a video: [A Day in the Life of a Japanese Hikikomori (Shut In)](https://youtu.be/pu9Ty9fxTHE) Sean made questions and camera plans. I shot myself based on his plan. He edited materials all by himself. So all credits should go to him. Thank you so much Sean and Nami!

 

As the results of the last AMA, I got interviewed by [Kyodo News](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/04/d5183b807f64-feature-what-japans-hikikomori-can-teach-us-about-self-isolation.html)(Japan), [Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/campus/2020-04/haeusliche-isolation-schlafrythmus-sport-hikikomori-coronavirus)(Germany), and recently [Konbini](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=642765539703450)(France).

My game Pull Stay could participate in online gaming event Guerrilla Collective in June, and Tokyo Game Show in September. I believe I couldn't make it to without the exposure from the last AMA.

I got to know some industry talents who have given me a lot of precious advice and exposure. Also, I've got to be involved with Tokyo-based indie game community [Asobu](https://asobu.dev/?lang=en), which has provided me a variety of opportunities and support. They noticed me because users on IAmA gave me a chance.

Everything looks rosy, right? But not 100% true, unfortunately...

I haven't still been able to secure my financial situation. This is another topic I was asked about lots in the last AMA. So I'd like to elaborate on it in this post.

When I came back to my hometown from Tokyo, 10 years ago, I didn't have savings much. Probably a few thousands of US$ or less. I lived in this house with my aunt, so I didn't need to pay living costs at all at first. But one year later, she moved to her son's house. I began to receive my living costs from her. I haven't spent money on hobbies and any other unnecessary things. I saved up the rest of the money she gave me. Or simply I didn't want to look on my bank account and recognize my financial dependency. I just ignored that.

Two summers ago, this financial support to me stopped due to the family decision. Since then, I have lived on my savings. As I wrote in the last AMA, I had attempted to become a doujin artist before I started learning game development. I published 2 ""books"" on online doujin stores, which has brought me about 9,000 US$ in total so far. Summarizing up, my bank account had around 18,000 US$ when I started burning my savings.

As of today, scraping up all of my fortune, I have 3,300 US$ which includes the fee from English-Japanese translation gig I did before, and also one-time COVID relief from the Japanese gov. So based on my burning rate, maybe I can survive next January, but can't reach the end of February. Yeah, I'm so stupid and crazy. I know that well man

A couple of months ago, I tried pitching my game to an indie game publisher to stabilize my finance. We had online chat and month-long conversations via email. But it didn't work out at the end of the day. I've been pushed into the corner. Don't starve, people say. But I'm almost seeing this Tim Burton style face of the Death.

You are so tolerant and put up with this poor guy's moan until this end? Well... I have something I'd like to tell you

I'm currently running the [Kickstarter campaign for my game Pull Stay](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1363912222/pull-stay?ref=nwzpno)

My life and future are 300% dependent on this campaign. I would extremely appreciate it if you take the time to check my game. Thank you so much for your kindest support!

OK, my begging was over. Please ask me anything, guys!

I’ve also covered intelligence agencies, most especially the CIA and CSIS. 
 
I started Brainwashed about a year ago, and I have to say, I’m pretty embarrassed I didn’t know the full history of MK-ULTRA, especially the Canadian connection. I also didn’t know so much of what I covered after 9/11 — such as the CIA’s interrogation methods — could be traced back to the Cold War. Here I was going all over the world and there was so much history to discover right in Montreal, like a five-hour drive from where I’m based in Toronto.

r/IAmA,jj396v,"Hi Reddit! Bill and Wei here. This AMA is part of #ImperialLates - this month exploring the science of wellbeing. [See the full programme here.](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/lates/)

We are researchers at Imperial College London and our lab’s central focus is understanding how, and why, we sleep. All terrestrial mammals sleep, and it is clear that sleep is essential for a *healthy* life, as well as being essential for *life itself.* Yet the most fundamental questions about sleep remain unresolved, possibly rendering it an afterthought for wellbeing with diet and exercise taking precedence. We are using molecular genetics and behavioural analysis in mice to address the following research questions:

**Why do we sleep?**   
One of the great mysteries of neuroscience is why we spend 30% of our lives in a state of vulnerable inactivity - sleep. What are the essential benefits that it provides? We are investigating an overlap that we have discovered between brain circuitry that drives sleep (particularly REM sleep) and circuitry that responds to stress. It's been proposed that one of the possible reasons we need REM sleep is to mitigate the effects of stressful experiences during waking. However, the brain circuits that might explain the connection between sleep and stress have not been identified. We are investigating such circuits in the hope that this will provide one of the reasons sleep is so necessary for a healthy life. 

**What drives us to sleep when we are sleep deprived?**   
The longer we do without sleep, the pressure to sleep builds inexorably until we are compelled to do so, pointing to sleep’s vital function. We have identified, and are studying, brain circuits in mice that respond to sleep deprivation and drive sleep when reactivated.   

**Does poor sleep cause neurological illness like Alzheimer’s disease?**   
Neurological illness, and conditions that lead to dementia, are growing in our society. Many, if not all, neurological disorders exhibit sleep disturbances at an early stage in disease progression. But now, many neuroscientists propose that the connection between sleep and neurological illness may work both ways and that poor sleep might actually cause, as well as exacerbate, the illness. We are investigating if this is true, looking at how sleep affects the presence of brain toxins, such as beta amyloids, which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease. 

**Our work is funded by Wellcome and the UK Dementia Research Institute. During this AMA we would love to answer any questions you have about our research or the neurological underpinnings of sleep. We'll be here 4-6 PM UK time today!**

r/IAmA,jhvez0,"Hey fellow Redditors! My name's Shaun and I founded the world's first game-based educational therapy programme — Swords &amp; Stationery (S&amp;S). We provide intervention for kids and teens with learning challenges (e.g. dyslexia) through a unique curriculum that directly incorporates tabletop games (such as RPGs like Savage Worlds and miniature wargames like Warhammer 40K)

After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Economics in 2012, I joined an NGO as an educational therapist in 2013 (a move that no one could have predicted). During my next four years as a therapist, I started to incorporate tabletop games into my therapy sessions. When I saw the change that these games could effect on the kids, I knew I had to take things one step further.

Thus, I founded Swords &amp; Stationery in 2017. The first two years were rocky, and I mean REALLY rocky. At the beginning of 2018, I only had $0.75 left in the company's bank account. Fortunately, a very lucky and risky gamble paid off, and since then we've managed to not just stay afloat, but also build a near-perfect track record.

So, if any of you have any questions on my journey as an entrepreneur or how I have managed to convince my clients that games are good for their kids, feel free to ask away :D

Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of rare genetic skin conditions that result in easy blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. Blisters and wounds can be caused by the slightest of touches, the skin is very slow to heal. It is usually referred to as the “worst disease you’ve never heard of” or skin as fragile as “butterfly skin”

There are different subtypes and severities. While I am mostly able to live as an independent adult, EB very much consumes every aspect of my life. 
I was born and raised in the United States, immigrated to Canada in 2015 and have had a vastly different experience in the health care system regarding my quality of life. 
There is no current cure, treatment for EB consists of bandaging the skin for protection and preventing infection as best as possible.

My newest film, [After Cherries](https://www.noelalejandrofilms.com/product/after-cherries/), tells the story of two men, tired of viral disinformation and growing conspiracy theories, who decide to escape by building their own hallucinogenic cosmos where they can play and exist outside the real world. 

You can also subscribe to my newsletter to get updates on new films and even receive special promotions and extra exclusive content. 

I would love to answer any questions about ""After Cherries"", my other films, how it is to write and direct porn and to satisfy any curiosity you might have about this world.

r/IAmA,jg75zr,"Hello, Reddit! We’re Ashish R. Panchal, M.D., Ph.D., Alexis Topjian, M.D., M.S.C.E., Khalid Aziz, M.B.B.S., M.A., M.Ed.(IT), Adam Cheng, M.D., and Katherine M. Berg, M.D. We’re medical experts who helped the American Heart Association to develop the newly published 2020 American Heart Association/Emergency Cardiovascular Care CPR guidelines.

Cardiac arrest – when the heart suddenly stops beating – results in death 97% of the time in the United States when it happens outside of the hospital setting (which is most of the time). Yesterday, the American Heart Association published its updated guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. The guidelines focus on the need to tackle health disparities and opioid-related incidents as well as early bystander and AED intervention, which remain key to the Chain of Survival. They also provide an extensive review of updates to evidence-based recommendations for CPR and emergency cardiovascular care training and response.

Key updates to the guidelines include:

•	New recommendations for recovery following CPR, which emphasize the physical, social and emotional needs of patients and their caregivers after survivors leave the hospital;

•	CPR training that now includes guidance on responding to victims of opioid overdose; and,

•	Suggestions for increasing lay rescuer CPR rates, noting that currently less than 40% of non-hospitalized adults experiencing cardiac arrest receive layperson-initiated CPR before the arrival of emergency medical services.

Overall, the 2020 Guidelines outline 491 recommendations specific to adult, pediatric and neonatal life support, resuscitation education science and systems of care. In addition to the updated and new written guidance, algorithms to help triage care were updated to reflect the latest science, and several major changes were also made to improve the visual training and performance aids.

**About the Experts:**

About Dr. Adam Cheng: Dr. Cheng is a Calgary-based professor at the Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute of the University of Calgary.

Unlike most other apps that have a singular purpose to entertain, help us organize, or socialize with friends, designing a weather app starts with saving lives by warning of threatening severe weather, and expands into helping people get the most out of their day so they can make the best choices about what to wear, when to run, the best time to take the dog for a walk, take a hike, go sailing, star gaze and much more. Weather impacts virtually every choice we make throughout our day and for planning our days ahead.

Did you know that one in nine men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime, and if you’re African American that risk increases by 79 percent and you’re twice as likely to die from it? There are many reasons for this health disparity, and my research focuses on understanding it and finding ways to reduce it. One simple thing all men can do to protect themselves is to talk to their doctor and have a plan for when to start screening for prostate cancer. It’s different for all men based on age, family history and other factors. The good news is, if it’s found early prostate cancer is almost 100% treatable.

Hi Reddit! We are a team of non-partisan voting experts who have spent all year watchdogging our elections to prepare for November 3rd (and the days after, until the election is certified.)
 
We believe our right to vote is sacred, and that every eligible voter -- whether they're Republicans, Democrats, or Independents -- all deserve a say in our future.
 
This is an absolutely unprecedented election. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how elections are done -- officials face higher demand than ever for absentee ballots, and more election lawsuits have been filed than any previous year. That's on top of the same threats we've dealt with year after year -- like long lines at the polls, partisan voter suppression schemes, and the need to secure our elections against interference.
 
This year, we have been engaged in legislation, litigation and other efforts to help every voter be heard. We'll have thousands of nonpartisan volunteers in the field and remotely working to make sure voters know their rights. Plus, we'll be watchdogging social media for disinformation that could make it more difficult for people to vote.
 
Want to know about the security and integrity of your ballot (absentee or in-person)? Curious about what a 'provisional ballot' is? Or how to 'cure' your ballot if something went wrong?
 
We're here to answer those questions and more. We are:
 
- Sylvia Albert, Director of Voting and Elections at Common Cause. Sylvia manages Common Cause's work for safe, secure, and accessible elections, including our litigation against unfair or suppressive voting rules. She helps our state leaders enact reforms like Automatic Voter Registration that help every eligible voter participate in our democracy. 
 
- Susannah Goodman, Director of Election Security at Common Cause. Susannah leads our work to help secure our election systems against infiltration and manipulation -- and works directly with local election officials to make sure they're following best practices, like ensuring all votes cast leave a verifiable paper trail, and auditing results after the fact to confirm accuracy.
 
We're here to answer any question you have about how to safely cast your ballot (and make sure it counts!)
 
The most important thing you can do is make your plan to cast your ballot this year -- and use the tools on [our website](https://www.commoncause.org/voting-tools/) to make sure you're ready to be heard. You can also help your friends and family know their rights by sharing reliable information from trusted sources, like your state's Secretary of State's website.

We’re days removed from one of the most contentious elections in U.S. history and Democratic candidate Joe Biden was elected the 46th president of the U.S. Instrumental to Biden’s victory were wins in key battleground states that in 2016 voted for the Republican Party. One of those states was Georgia, a state that had not gone blue in the presidential elections since 1992 when Bill Clinton beat George H.W. Bush. The margin of victory in the Peach State was so slim that the state has said there will be a recount.The Savannah Morning News newspaper is one of the oldest newspapers in the state and its politics team has had a front row seat to everything that led to last week’s elections, including two senate races that are headed a runoff in January.

It could make you draw, write riddles, rhyme, or even think of slogans. There's different ways to play with your friends and compete to get the most laughs.

I partnered with [Juniper](https://www.junipercreates.com), a Toronto-based studio that specializes in creating custom products for content creators, to bring the game to life, and we've been working on this for almost a year now. We're on Kickstarter to be able to mass manufacture the game and get it into everyone's hands, and also to make a really cool expansion pack while we're at it. 

I'm also going to be hosting a Charity Livestream event on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jacksfilms) on November 21st at 7pm ET, called YIAY Gives Back, with some amazing content creators you know and love. We're going to be playing YIAY: The Board Game to compete for a jackpot to go to the charity of the winner's choosing. All funds donated during the stream will also add to this pot. Join us and help us raise money for a good cause!

[Proof!] (https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZkTeYMok6iDHa2NSA)

Now, that being said, Ask Me Anything!

r/IAmA,jr4mxj,"Hey Reddit,

I'm Chris and I absolutely HATE moving! 

Recently my wife and I were moving AGAIN and struggling to decide between hiring movers to take the burden off of doing it all ourselves, and renting a Uhaul and signing all the paperwork and paying all the extra fees at the end and hauling it all ourselves. We ended up renting a van and just dealing with the pain of moving ourselves, and then to make matters worse, we ended up not having room for one last piece of furniture in the back and had to come back with the Uhaul for a round 2 pick up. I found myself wishing I knew someone with a pickup that could just toss it in the back and be on our way, but unfortunately, no luck there! I knew there had to be an easier way - but it wasn't easy to find.

**So I built it**. I was inspired by apps like Uber and Lyft, and built a similar example — it's called **Yazz** — It's an app that finds a ride for your stuff instead of you. People/ drivers with a van or a pick-up truck get your items from point A to point B the same way you would use a ride-sharing app. Feel free to check it out, I would really appreciate any feedback/ thoughts you guys have!

**Reign** **of** **Darkness** is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). It is a third-person, PC-based Apocalyptic set in the Medieval Period which references historical events interpreted with artistic license. Reign draws inspiration from many of its predecessors in the MMORPG genre while creating its own niche conceptually and mechanically.

We have been growing and developing our game.

Reign of Darkness is released on Steam and currently is in early access. We have been making major headway, in our development process! As of lately, we have been making huge changes and updates adding a ton more content to the game since we have launched.

We also have reworked all of our social media, Discord, etc. Discord Link: [https://discord.gg/RXKfHph](https://discord.gg/RXKfHph)

I am Florida criminal defense attorney Doug Leifert ([https://www.leifertlaw.com/our-firm/douglas-i-leifert-esq/](https://www.leifertlaw.com/our-firm/douglas-i-leifert-esq/)) at Leifert &amp; Leifert. As a former prosecutor and a current criminal defense lawyer, I have an abundance of knowledge and experience when it comes to our criminal justice system. This past year, Florida passed a law that allows someone with a first time DUI charge to have it reduced to a reckless driving charge. With the winter holidays fast approaching, chances are we'll be seeing an uptick in DUI arrests over the next few months. I will be answering questions on first-time DUI offenders having a chance for their charge to become a reckless driving charge.

Here is my \[proof\] ([https://www.facebook.com/LeifertLaw/posts/10158028720106559](https://www.facebook.com/LeifertLaw/posts/10158028720106559)), my \[website\] ([https://www.leifertlaw.com/](https://www.leifertlaw.com/)), and information on the \[topic\] “[Lawmaker combines 'accountability' and 'compassion' in drunk driving bill](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/07/florida-drunk-driving-bill-combines-accountability-compassion/2832048001/)” - Tallahassee Democrat

r/IAmA,js7tz5,"TL;DR: We are researchers and a journalist here today to answer questions you might have on the lack of transparency and the misuse of some basic scientific principles that we have observed and on which we gathered data during COVID19. We hope to provide you with a multidisciplinary outlook of this and to answer all your questions. 

--------

We are Clémence Leyrat, Corentin Segalas, Lonni Besançon,  and Julien Hernandez 4 researchers and a scientific journalist who have looked at COVID19 research and potential misuses of basic transparency research principles. 

[Our findings are available as a preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.249847) and [all our data is available online](https://osf.io/renxy/). To sum up, our findings are that:

Preprints (non peer-reviewed manuscripts) on COVID19 have been mentioned in the news approximately 10 times more than preprints on other topics published during the same period.

- Approximately 700 articles have been accepted for publication in less than 24 hours, among which 224 were detailing new research results. Out of these 224 papers, 31% had editorial conflicts of interest (i.e., the authors of the papers were also part of the editorial team of the journal).

- There has been a large amount of duplicated research projects probably leading to potential scientific waste.

- There have been numerous methodologically flawed studies which could have been avoided if research protocols were transparently shared and reviewed before the start of a clinical trial.

- Finally, the lack of data sharing and code sharing led to the now famous [The Lancet scandal on Surgisphere](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lancet-retracts-surgispheres-study-on-hydroxychloroquine-67613)

We hope that we can all shed some light on our findings and answer your questions. So there you go, ask us anything.

r/IAmA,jstt6g,"Hello Reddit!

We are Kaspersky’s Global Research &amp; Analysis Team (GReAT), a group of 40+ threat hunters spread throughout 18 countries around the world. We track malicious hacker activity around the globe with an emphasis on advanced targeted attacks.

In case you are not familiar with us, we are the ones, who [told the world] about the Cozy Bear hacking group long before they broke into DNC servers, the ones who uncovered the most sophisticated to date hacking group called [Equation] and the most dangerous gang of cyber robbers – [Carbanak]. We were the first who figured out that the notorious NotPetya ransomware, which caused real chaos all around the world, [was actually not ransomware but a wiper] -  a real cyber weapon. We are the ones who drew the line between one of the oldest attacks ever against Pentagon and the activity of modern day hacking groups.  

Every day we see malicious hackers doing crazy things like [hiding their activity in satellite communications], [infecting hotel networks] to spy on very important guests, or even targeting [telecom operators networks]- to spy on whoever they want! We have seen them breaking into the supply chain of a [popular hardware producer] in order to be able to infect only a few specific users. We also witnessed how one hacking group [tried to pretend to be another hacking group] in order to place false flags and potentially cause an international scandal.

One day we even found them [poking around in our own network]! And so on...

All of these are only a few stories we have to tell. Many more of them you can find here, at https://securelist.com .Today we are happy to answer your questions about how we do all our anti cyber espionage threat hunting magic every day. 

[Here is a photo of some of us just for you!]

Here with us are:     

Want to know how we work, how we hunt down all those sophisticated actors and learn some tips and tricks?

Edit 3: We'll wrap up for today, but we're coming back tomorrow to answer remaining questions! Cyaa!
Edit 4: We are back to answer remaining questions!
Edit 5:   

Dear friends, thanks a lot for all your love, good questions, good jokes and the good time!   

To all Reddit users who are asking questions about our data processing policies, politics, alleged connections with governments and questions related to trust. We fully understand your concerns and are willing to eliminate them. So if you are really seeking for answers to your questions, and are here not just to troll, then here you go: 
 
* We are open for cooperation and are more transparent than anyone else in the industry. You can read more about our transparency initiative here: https://www.kaspersky.com/about/transparency?ignoreredirects=true. It was created specifically to explain our technology and processes to those who are concerned. 
 
* Although we are an international company that is obliged to obey local laws in countries where we operate, not all laws concern our activity. Particularly we are often asked about SORM. This law is about tracking criminals through telecom networks. We are not a telecom operator, or a video-calling service or a chat app. This law doesn't concern us at all: 
 
* Last but not least: we are often asked how safe is the data of our users. Apart from what has been already said about our will to be as transparent as possible, we could only add two things: 
    1. We give our users control to limit the data they send to us via the interface of our products. If you are a user of our B2B products, we have solutions that allow you not to upstream any data at all. 
    2. This year we are completing relocation of data processing for our users from Europe, US, and several other countries to Switzerland.  

It's time we wrap up our AMA and hope to see you all soon!
Peace!"

This year, Ludwig van Beethoven turns 250. Instead of letting it be overshadowed by the pandemic, I’m part of a 24-hour celebration that takes place on Wednesday, December 16, 2020–on Beethoven’s exact 250th birthday.

Everyone is invited to the party! In that way, all around the planet, on December 16, Beethoven’s voice rings out, loudly and clearly, across the whole universe of human experience.

r/IAmA,jt2jv1,"I’m Kyleanne Hunter and I spent over a decade as an officer in the United States Marine Corps, flying the AH-1W “Super Cobra” attack helicopter, with multiple combat deployments. I currently study suicide prevention in military and veteran communities. . 

From both personal and scholarly experience, I know too well the battles that we as veterans are facing,  especially this year—including mental health challenges like post-traumatic stress and depression, and economic anxiety in a challenging job market. The added stress of the pandemic is making navigating challenges even more difficult. 
 Tragically, every day in the United States, 17 veterans die by suicide. When I hear that chilling number, I can’t help but think that many of these deaths may have been prevented with access to adequate mental health care, safe gun storage, and other interventions.

I include safe gun storage among those other lifesaving interventions because firearms are uniquely fatal, and the method used in the majority of completed veteran suicides. When someone has access to a gun in a moment of crisis, they rarely get a second chance to live a full life. And nearly [half of all veterans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5735043/), including myself, own at least one firearm. 

If we want to truly honor our veterans every day, not only on Veterans Day, we must take action to support lifesaving interventions to prevent veteran suicide. And one easy step we can all take is storing any guns in our households safely, and having conversations with our friends and family about their gun storage practices and their mental wellness. I know this from experience—a “buddy check” in a time of crisis once saved my life. 

Safe gun storage is how we can prevent “[family fire](https://www.endfamilyfire.org/),” a term for all injuries and deaths that results from improperly stored or misused guns found in the home. You can visit [http://www.EndFamilyFire.org](https://www.endfamilyfire.org/) for more resources and safe storage tips. And if you or anyone you know is in an immediate crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741.

We are here to talk to you about [Voices In Action's](http://www.voicesinaction.org)  new campaign: Be ProVoice. We believe it shouldn’t take being brave to report sexual assault. It should be as ordinary as reporting a stolen car or any other crime.

I created VIA to make this a reality and to use technology to build a global documenting platform to make sure serial predators are identified and caught faster. 

We are here to answer your question about our experiences, our careers, and why we believe everyone should Be ProVoice. We're also raising money for Voices in Action to build this next phase of so we can change the culture in Hollywood, in Corporate America, in our homes and so we can help survivors all over the globe.

r/IAmA,jvj5pw,"Hey Reddit

My fiance and I live in Clare County, Michigan  I grew up here.  Moved away during college for a bit,  spent a considerable amount of time in IT Hell downstate.     My best friend is Amish,  and his family and I are all close friends.  They are like family to me.  

PROOF [https://imgur.com/a/f8sLQ91](https://imgur.com/a/f8sLQ91)   Thats the vehicles ive used over the years to haul stuff.  

**How I got Started as a driver for the Amish:** 

In Fall of 2014 I moved back from downstate,   I rented a house from an Amish lady, next to a wonderful Amish family,  and ended up getting to know them really well.  Turns out we all went swimming and hung out as kids.  The house I rented was a mile from where I grew up.    Day after new years,  Amish neighbor comes over and says hey,  can you haul a wagon down to the Amish school?   I had a 2001 Silverado 1500 at the time and said sure Ill do it.    Been driving for them ever since.  At one point I was driving for 3 different Amish guys,  but I cut back to just my best friend and his family as I was on the road 6 days a week.  

**What an Amish Driver does:**

I drive them to and from appointments, grocery stores,  anywhere they want to go.   I also haul everything you can think of,  lumber, heavy equipment you name it I haul it.  

I just recently got back from Carroll County Ohio,  I took my best friend and his family down to his sisters place so he could deer hunt and visit his grandparents which are in their 90s.  

During the winter I take the Amish children to and from to school 5 days a week,  It is safer for me to drive them the 3 miles to the school then it is to take the horse and buggy in the winter.   People do not respect buggies on the roads.  And with human trafficking going on in Michigan its just safer to take the children.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Income from Driving:**

People who drive for the Amish on average make between .75 cents and a dollar per mile.  The amish pay for the fuel.    And if something breaks down on a vehicle they gladly pay for it and help get it fixed right up.  

  
Im open to any and all questions about the Amish,  I will answer it to the best of my knowledge,  if I cant answer it,  Ill call my amish friend up and ask him.    He was thrilled that I was doing this."

r/IAmA,jwfy7c,"Hi Reddit!
[We're a team](https://worldwideweed.nl/about/) of cannabis researchers from 16 different countries and we've formed the Global Cannabis Cultivation Research Consortium to better understand the patterns and practices of small-scale cannabis growers. The first round of our survey, the International Cannabis Cultivation Questionnaire v1, was conducted in 2012 and helped break apart a lot of the stereotypes about cannabis growers. Now we've launched the second round of the [survey](www.worldwideweed.nl), the ICCQ 2, and we're keen gather as many responses as possible from around the world to ensure that cannabis growers are understood as real people, not caricatures.

We're here today to answer your questions about cannabis and cannabis growing, and drug policy. While cannabis growing is the focus of this project, our team has expertise across many areas of drugs policy as well, so feel free to really Ask Us Anything about drugs and we'll do our best to get the right person on your post. Unfortunately we're social scientists, not botanists or chemists, so we're more likely to talk about deterrence theory and policy making than give you advice on the best nutrient recipe for a 4x4 tent grow using coco coir and CMH bulbs.  That said, we'd like to hear yours...

The GCCRC has team members from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Israel, Italy, New Zealand (so close guys!), Portugal, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay. Don't worry, even if your country isn't represented you can still [take the survey!](https://worldwideweed.nl/)

We would really appreciate your participation in our survey. We take your [privacy very seriously](https://worldwideweed.nl/security-and-anonymity/) and don't use any cookies or IP tracking. We also don't take money from cannabis producers or retailers, and our data is not intended for commercial use. We're a bunch of academics who care about good cannabis policy and are interested in exploring an area of drugs policy often overlooked by prohibitionist regimes that are focused on measuring arrests and not on why a person who grows cannabis does so. Our survey covers a lot of ground, including views on regulations about growing cannabis, how you grow your cannabis, and what you do with it once you've processed it.

We're launching this AMA at 9am US Eastern time (New York) and will have members of the team swinging through to answer questions throughout the day. We'll try to remember to sign our names and country with each response.

Thanks for the opportunity to talk with you today!

Edit 20:30 US ET: Thanks all. It's been a great 12 hours and we really appreciate all your questions. Please take some time to share you insights with us by taking the survey at www.worldwideweed.nl. You can also contact us via that website if you have any questions. Cheers All!"
r/IAmA,jwhvgc,"Hi Reddit! I’m Dr Bonnie Waring, an ecologist and Senior Lecturer at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment. I head up The Waring Ecology Lab, which investigates how the ecology of plant and soil microbial communities influences the carbon cycle and its feedbacks on climate change. 

What are the pitfalls and benefits of reforestation and afforestation? What role can forests play in tackling climate change? These are the central questions of my current research. 

Large-scale tree planting is an increasingly popular component of global efforts to meet climate targets. However, forests are complex ecosystems, and poorly planned planting efforts can actually increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increase global warming. My research explores how carbon flows between the atmosphere and its two other major reservoirs on land: plants and soils.  

I’ll be back to answer questions at 16:00 GMT on Wednesday 18 November (11:00 ET). Ask Me Anything.

In Sept. 2018, I quit my job because I didn't like the direction that the web (or for that matter, my own life) was taking.

This is by the way the second time I post this, but the last one rightfully got deleted after 5 minutes a couple of days ago (I didn't follow the guidelines for providing the proof, sorry my bad). So this is the second try!

Since it's quite a hidden topic I'd like to show Reddit that these issues exist. This is also the reason we started this project. Beforehand, as a small disclaimer: I'm not a psychologist nor mental health professional in general, so some questions about personal situations I will not answer, due to the fact that professionals can provide better help for this. But what I can do is share our findings and summarize the experiences of the protagonists (of which some of them now work as mental health professionals, helping others with recovering from eating disorder). In general, to just give a better understanding about this topic! Which is definitely necessary.

So shoot: AMA about the project, topic or just life!

EDIT 1: Guys, sorry but after a long day it's sleeping time! Tomorrow I'll wake up a bit earlier to answer some of your questions still, so you can definitely still send them in. I will try to answer as many as possible. Thanks for your interest, question and all the kind words. I didn't expect it to have so many comments and upvotes, so that's really amazing!

With the help of UMKC clinical students and my co-counsel, Cindy Dodge,  I represented Ricky for more than a decade and eventually got him released last year. I’ve spent decades working to overturn wrongful convictions, especially for inmates on death row. Before that I was the chief public defender in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1985 through 1989.
 
Ricky’s story and how it illustrates the greater crisis in America’s public defender systems was the subject of a PBS NewsHour podcast called [“Broken Justice,”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice) released last year. In October, about a year after Ricky was released, producer Frank Carlson checked in with him [for a special episode](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice/an-update-from-ricky-kidd).

Edit: 

Ricky: I’m happy that we had this time! It is always fun to be with the PBS NewsHour team, along with the one individual who first believed in me, who ultimately never left my side until I came home. A fun and exciting year it has been and looking forward to the next chapter with I Am Resilience/new baby/marriage/purposed living. Feel free to listen to ""Broken Justice"" if you haven’t had a chance, and if you would like to support and participate in the next chapter forward for me, feel free to follow this link and share as much as possible: https://linktr.ee/IAR

Sean: In closing: Until we reform indigent defense systems, this story will play out over and over again. There are lots of ways to get involved, and lots of good people trying to change the system. Find out who is doing the work in your community, and support them. Sister Helen Prejean says if all you can do is bake a pie, bake a pie and bring it to a meeting! I'm happy to say Ricky's team was kept well-fed by people who care."

r/IAmA,jxv1ur,"Hi Reddit! I’m Melody Schreiber, a freelance journalist covering everything from the effects of climate change on mental health in the Arctic to the changing tides of livelihoods in the Chesapeake Bay. Most recently, I published a book of personal essays by writers who had or were premature babies. When my water broke three months early, I did what I’ve always done in times of stress—I looked for books. I wanted to find a book that reflected all of the complicated feelings of premature birth in intimate stories, and I couldn’t find it. So, I made it—What We Didn’t Expect: Personal Stories of Premature Birth.

Living through my son’s prematurity and health complications also inspired me to become a postpartum doula. I completed my training through DONA, the largest professional organization of birth and postpartum doulas.

One in ten babies are born premature, which means 400,000 families in the U.S. welcome premature babies every year. Since November is Prematurity Awareness Month, ask me anything!

My name is Annie Nikunen. I am an NYC-based flutist, composer, dancer and choreographer, as well as sound artist and radio broadcaster. As a flutist, I am a founding member of new music group BlackBox Ensemble, and have performed in contemporary, classical, jazz, dance and Taize settings. My compositional work ranges from concert music and field recordings to dance and film; I explore connections between composition and choreography, always considering the physicality of sound in relation to movement and space. I also explore dynamics of human relationships in my work, including cycles of brokenness and healing, and how sound and movement can represent those processes. Ballet was my initial career track, so I vowed to incorporate my love for movement into my work with sound. On the media side, I am a music/dance reviewer for Bachtrack, and served as Director of the Classical Department and Business Manager at WKCR, where I host a weekly show every Friday featuring the music of New York City Ballet as well as choral, orchestral and film works.

I was asked to become a host for the Beethoven marathon on his birthday!

r/IAmA,jy90ak,"**Good girls TL;DR first:**

Corona situation forced us to accelerate our dreams to leave hectic civilisation and start a new life in paradise without money and stuff being priority anymore.

We were refugees in exactly opposite direction as most others are, left “supposedly happy” life in Germany and moved to Africa with our kid and 3 cats.

Ask us anything.

**Edit:** i might have underestimated how violently patroitic are some Germans about their falling empire, threatening me and using false information to contradict my decissions or post or ridiculing me just because of my work. Still if you are in similar situation and need help, in Germany or otherwise, do not fear to contact me (would understand why you do not want to post your comment publicly) over PM.

Edit2: to clear, we didnt need safety net from German government but we knew we wouldn't get any anyway. Our decission was based on the fact that Covid removed our main source of income and would leave us to further pay high taxes and costs of living in Germany while being forced to do job nobody wants to do (aka Job you have to do after failing to find steady job your self). There is no support for self employed after 6 months and even after 3 months you get hell.

**Story:**

Hello Reddit,

We are Yulia and Fred, photographers from Germany. As probably many, especially introvert people, being constantly depressed in expensive, money-oriented environment where everything has to be unified to not break the huge taxes-making machine.

Corona situation basically stripped us from any profit or chance for the future as it removed all our sources of income while keeping sick costs of everything else same. After losing a house due to land-lord lost her job, medical insurance and even child support we decided to finally pull the plug and do what we dreamed about for many years. We spend all lockdown to prepare.

We sold everything, literally everything in biggest Yard-sale we ever experienced our self.

Fixed our 30 years old car by our self, rebuilt it into provisional camper.

Made international passports for all our “kids”

Slept for the last time in comfortable bed, thinking about the future.

In May we said goodbye to all our friends and family and loved ones.

Packed everything what was left to our car. And went on the road through empty corona infested Europe. Seeing only truckers and refugees going opposite direction.

After somehow reaching Spain we were stopped at gunpoint by police and returned back to Germany (even though we had papers documenting purpose of our travel) as it was still illegal to travel (how did we passed alle the checkpoint is another story).

We then lived almost a month in temporary conditions until borders were open again in middle of June. Raced again down over 3000km to South of Spain. Boarded first ferry to Africa / Canaries after complete lockdown, spent almost two days on the sea finally arriving to our paradise. There we bought for few hundred Euros a house and started to renovate it.

Until then surviving away from real civilisation in temporary homes like this one usually without a flowing water and solar power only.

It’s been 5 months where we averaged 230€ expenses per month (for 6 of us + 100-200€ rents) compared to just medical insurance 687€ per month we had to pay in Germany just for one of us.

We sometime feel that world is getting progressively crazier so still believe we made a right move even after 5 months struggling here. We even created a website and blog to help and be in touch with like-minded individuals around the world.

r/IAmA,jy9ltu,"Greetings traveler, please sit and hear my story.

I've spent 6+ hours a day sitting at a computer since I was 14 or 15. I now sit at a computer for most of my working day.

As I've gotten older I've really started to notice the effects on my body (knees and eyes mostly). Unfortunately I can't just stop using a computer because my livelihood depends on it.

To deal with this, I've just built a prototype for a desktop app which reminds the user to check their posture (and drink water and take regular breaks). I've tried to make these reminders as polished and aesthetically pleasing as possible (the existing software in this space is super old and corporate looking).

This is a ask me anything about anabolic steroids. or to do with my porn career, I make cash through a vast source of incomes, from my adult work, from gyms I own and run personally, and A fair few other investments i've put my money into. there is a few reasons i'm doing this ama the reason for the porn side is I get a lot of questions asking me what it's like, what I do, it is crazy, is it sexy? sometimes, sometimes it is pure work and there is parts like any job you hate/dislike i've met some awesome people and ive met some complete muppets. on the anabolic side of things the reason for doing this is simple, I normally always post in the other boards. But I commonly get messages from women wanting to lose weight, build muscle, or even use anabolics steroids, I also get questions from men curious or asking about their girlfriends etc. Over the years I have been a variety of sizes, I have been the level of a female bodybuilder, I've been 105lbs and ripped/lean, I've been skinny, and originally I was over weight at 260lbs, I had PCOS and struggled a lot when I was younger, I got down to around 110 before I ever touched drugs using heavy weights and cardio along with an excellent diet, this is to answer any questions you might have, I have used a lot of gear, I have made mistakes, And i'm here to share it all, I've had 100s of clients over the years, Women who want to use steroids to get huge no matter what the cost! something I wouldn't do. But I respect everyones decision, I've had some wanting to get big but look as feminine as possible, others wanting to get ripped/lean, some just wanting to be models. I know 100s of girls who lie to their partners, steroid usage in women is far more common then one would have you believe. I know girls who are as feminine as can come hiding their anavar and primo in the bottom of yogurt for example. unfortunately many ladies will deny it or just not be honest with it. so there is a lot of bad information spread via steroid usage. With the photos, I've done the one as proof to verify myself, then with the others ive put a vast amount, the ones at the top are what I use to look like. when I was over over weight, to when I was a more skinny weight, to when I started bodybuilding, the first attachment is my training photos and the ones at the bottom of it are how I currently look now, the ones above/top are the different stages of my training career so you get an idea of the sizes i;ve been, now im going for a bit more feminine look, And looking at some possible facial work, fillers, lips, and possibly fat transfer to the face as ive been interested in the look, but I may not do all of them. Current work i've had done is breast enlargements obviously. anyway everything in the first link is safe for work. the second link is a few photos to the more adult type. i'd like to say i've kept it classy, but how do you keep porn classy? what i;ve done is put photos that are not explict or completely revealing, so that is not ""offensive"" material, Ie there is no penetration/dildo/oral/spread legged photos etc. and done my best to keep it as sfw on the second link as possible. but common sense with the type of work I do, viewing the first one is fine, the second one I would not view at work. and would still label it as NSFW I just didn't want to put my extreme photos in there and take away from what im trying to do.

as stated I am here to answer ANY QUESTIONS, As long as it's not rude or stupid, I'm happy to answer anything as indepth as I can.
